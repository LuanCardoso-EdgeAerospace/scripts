Custom script for replicating the zfs folder into the backup NAS.

The script does this steps:

- Creates a temporary snapshot
- mounts the NAS directory using nfs
- rsync from the snapshot into the nfs
- unmounts 
- deletes the temporary snapshot.
- Appends logfile to ~/nasSync.log

Important notes:

- The nfs credentials are managed by the NAS.
- Syncronization to the NAS is enough, as it uses BTRFS and a snapshot retention policy (similar to the one set in the zfs storage) is in place.
- This script is installed in crontab, to run every day at 1am. Shouldn't take too long to run since the transfer is done with deltas.
